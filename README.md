# MarsRover

This is a simple Mars Rover application meant to meet the requirements of the problem seen in MarsRover.pdf.  The application is broken up into individual classes/methods following SOLID Design.  I did NOT use DI because it felt like overkill for a small application like this.  Also used Static classes to try and limit the need to create new instances of things.

Assumptions Made:
1)  The input will always meet the format that was provided as Test Input; can rely on NASA Engineers to follow instructions.
2)  It only allows for 2 rovers, but can be configured for additional ones.
